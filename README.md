# MAT311-AI-Assignment

  The benefits and drawbacks of AI are very evident to me after I finished this assignment as the ease it creates can influence someone's understanding level for good or for bad. Some of the benefits I found was that it helped me to focus less on remebering correct syntax or one specific method that I neede to write and it eliminated a lot of my just "human" correctness type errors that would be easily fixable by just having the AI review or write my code for me. Some of the drawbacks that could be seen for someone that hasn't had experience with data science would be that they wouldn't know when the AI was messing up or what to tell the AI to tweak it. Since the AI is dependent on the information you give it, if you give it a bad prompt, then it will not produce what you would like it to. Someone without prior knowledge probably wouldn't know what to do if their code the AI gives them runs into erros or what the plots are supposed to look like if they are incorrect.

  Examples where I needed to verify the AI output for correctness was mainly for checking a lot of the graphs. I needed to verify it's output when I checked the axes, the variables involved, and what labels/titles where put onto the graph. I verfied the outputs it gave me by just running the code it had for me then editing my prompts until it gave me something that looked like what was in the original analysis graphs and charts.
